# pyNes

This my python version of the code/tutorial found at [David Barr's github](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES) and [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrOv9FMX8xJHqMvSGB_9G9nZZ_4IgteYf). This is my attempt to learn how emulators works, and not an attempt to make my own code: It is a translation of **his code** into python. So all thanks goes to David Barr!

## In progress
Emulation of the 6502 cpu found in the NES.

## TODO
- Get the APU and PPU to work
- Integrate this with pygame to be able to actually play...

# License to be safe...
